# End_to_End_lane_shape_prediction_using_transformers

In this project, We have taken the "TuSimple" dataset and the base paper was "End-to-End lane shape prediction with Transformers". We have achieved the base paper results and tried to test their model in our institute as we have taken some pics of our institute roads. We also have used pretrained semantic segmentation model to evaluate the test results with TuSimple dataset.
In this project my teammate was Saswata Sarkar from my institute.
